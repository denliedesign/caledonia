            At the Caledonia Dance & Music Center, we provide your child the skills they need to enjoy dance and music for a lifetime.  By offering a large variety of classes for students as young as 12 months old, we are able to introduce dance to virtually everyone.  Students learn not only dance technique, history, and the latest styles, but they also learn valuable life skills.  Our faculty is made up of qualified dancers and musicians who are passionate about the arts and sharing their love of dance and music with children.  These worthy role models are trained in all areas of dance, enabling us to offer you superior classes in tap, ballet, jazz, lyrical, hip hop, musical theater, pointe, and specialty classes for preschoolers and adults.  Music teachers are university trained in voice, piano, guitar and string instruments.  Private and group music lessons are available.
            <br><br>
            Our students participate in numerous performances.  Many of Caledonia Dance & Music Center's students have been seen and awarded at regional and national competitions.  For over 30 years, we have danced at the Grand Rapids Festival of the Arts, the nation's largest all-volunteer festival.  Students young and old have performed at multiple July 4th Celebrations and parades, nursing homes, and all students take part in our annual spring recitals.  Our liturgical dancers have danced and worshiped at several local churches.  Caledonia Dance & Music Center's students share their gift of dance and music with the community.
            <br><br>
            We hope that your family will join us in experiencing the joy of dance and music.
